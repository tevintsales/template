This is a small application that I made that converts United States dollars into the currency of the country that the user is currently located in. By using Android Studio and Google Maps API I was able to get the user's current location and geocode information to allow me to research and convert USD to a specific currency. 

Some of the work I've done on this application so far includes:
- Setting up Android Studio with Google Play Service SDK
- Setting up UI using Layouts, Views, Lists etc.
- Using Google's map API and setting it up to work with a Map activity.
- Using Google's map API to find the user location and get information from it using Geocoder.
- Applying the user's geocode information to convert user entered amounts into another countries currency.

By applying myself to this project I have learned a lot about Android development using the Android Studio environment. I have also learned to how to effectively set up Google Maps API with Android activities.

This is a work in progress Android application which I am creating along side taking a the udemy course : <a href="https://www.udemy.com/complete-android-n-developer-course/learn/v4/overview">Android N Developer Course</a>.
This project is helping me learn about the devlopment process of Android applications as well as some Google API impelentaions for map applications.

Some of the work I've done on this application so far includes:
- Passing values from different Views using Intents.
- Setting up UI using Layouts, Views, Lists etc.
- Using Google's map API and setting it up to work with an app.
- Using Google's map API to find the user location and get information from it using Geocoder.

By applying myself to this project I am not only learning about Android development, I am also building up more experience programming in Java which I have become rusty at.

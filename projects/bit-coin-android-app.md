This was a coding challenge from the online course I am currently taking at Udemy called <a href="https://www.udemy.com/android-app-development-with-java/learn/v4/content">Android O & Java - Mobile App Development</a>.
It required me to use API calls found at <a href="https://bitcoinaverage.com/">bitcoinaverage.com</a> and parsing the JSON data retrieved to display the current value of 1 Bitcoin in a given currency.
The user is also able to change the target currency via slider and that data will be appended onto the URL call for the HTTP request.

This project was very valuable as it taught me a lot about API calls and parsing data from JSON objects.
Because of this knowledge I will be able to create a wider variety of apps that allow me to get data from the internet and use it accordingly.

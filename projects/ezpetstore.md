  This 2D platformer game is a game I created after watching a few tutorial videos on how to use Gamemaker studio. In this game you control two character simutaneously as you try to solve the puzzles and escape the level. The room is split into two, however, each room has small differences which can lead to character death. The room on the right holds a switch that unlocks the next level for the character on the left. 

  For this project, the mechanics of the game were written using "GML" or Game Maker Language. All of the code that I had writted was based off of a tutorial series that I had watched by Shaun Spalding. This was an entierly solo project, however, all of the artwork besides the character was found on opengameart.org and was used purely for educational purposes. 

  Through this project I learned the foundation of game development as well as an understanding of how a normal workflow using Gamemaker Studio was. Although "GML" is not a language used outside of Gamemaker Studio this was the first finished(mechanics wise) game that I had created and the experience from that was very valuable.

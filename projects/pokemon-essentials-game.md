This is a work in progress Pokemon game made in RPG Maker XP using the Pokemon Essentials add-on. All of the resources for the project such as scripts, audio, and graphics are taken from outside resources and I will specify where the credit is due once the game is finished.

The work I have done includes:
- Finding files graphics online and slightly editing them using GIMP.
- Using GIMP to create tilesets and animations to fit the RPG Maker XP style. 
- Alterations of pre-existing Ruby scripts found online to tailor it to my needs.
- Create game logic and loops that consists of story telling and events.

As stated earlier, this project is for purely educational purposes so to learn more about game development using different game engines. So far I have learned how to setup game events due to player choice and results. I also learned how to properly resize, crop, and recolor sprites so that it fits a specific style. There are many different aspects that go into game development and this project is helping me develop an effective workflow for managing all the resources that I need to use.

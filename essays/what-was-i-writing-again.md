## The power of Coding Standards!
Have you ever looked back at code you've written years ago only to find out you have no idea what you've done? Did you wish you had some way to code efficiently so that you'll never forget where you left off again? Well fear not! Through the power of ES Lint and Coding standards you can write code that your 5 year future self will understand easily!

## What was going on?
All jokes aside, coding standards can actually help the process of writing a clean project. If you have the ability to read your code no matter how much time has passed it will do wonders and will actually be able to help you finish projects faster. Throughout my college career I've tried my hand at creating multiple projects only to lose interest in them and forget that I even started it in the first place. These include half finished games, almost working apps, and quickly made websites. When I go back to these projects and try to figure out what was going through my mind at that time I have a hard time.

## Working together
If I can't understand what was my thought process for my projects then there's no way anyone else would be able to figure out what I was doing. Moving forward in my life I will need to work together with various people so coding standards will help me clean up my act.

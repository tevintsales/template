## Summoning Meteor Dragon in Attack Mode
Nothing protecting me on my side of the field I take a direct attack from the Meteor Dragon and lose some life points.
As this essay is being written a worldwide phenomenon known as the Twitch.tv Yu-Gi-Oh is happening. Because of this my learning of Meteor has been intertwined with the nostalgic feelings of the trading card game. The card called "Meteor Dragon" has a description text that states "This dragon appeared from the sky and crashed to the earth.". This description perfectly describes my thoughts when I first encountered Meteor. A sudden appearance of a monster and I knew that it would be no easy task to defeat it.

## Evening the playing field
In terms of Yu-Gi-Oh, the only way of fighting back would be to summon monsters of your own and destroy the beast known as "Meteor Dragon". The monsters I chose to help me out to defeat it were the Blaze tutorials, various stack overflow resources, and the screencasts provided. With the power of those cards I was able to combat back the Meteor Dragon and destroy it, in other words, I was able to understand how to work my way around Meteor.

If we take a step away from the syntax and structures of Meteor there still is the main issue that I run into no matter what.
This is the issue of time. The time it takes for Meteor to initialize a project and start up is insanely long. It roughly takes me
thirty minutes to an hour to get everything up and running.

## Fusing to create the Meteor Black Dragon
When I finally thought I was in the clear I get hit with fusion between Meteor and Mongo. As if it wasn't hard enough to counter the Meteor
Dragon can fuse together with another beast to create the "Meteor Black Dragon" which nearly doubles its previous power. Meteor and Mongo together
create a devastating combo that can wipe out any unprepared fool that tries to take it on, just like the Meteor Black Dragon. The only way to fight back is to gather up all of the resources that you can and prepare to take on the challenge.

  Technology is alive. It is a forever growing beast that we need to be able to tame and use to our advantage. It is up to the Software Engineers to battle the beast and create user experiences for the common people. 

## Software in the world
  Whether you realize it or not, software is present in almost everything in the world. It could be a part of an actual computer or manufactured by the machinery that utilizes it. Software makes it so we can do even more with less effort. It can make ridiculously hard problems be done in an instant. It be comes a challenge between the engineers and the technology and I want to be a part of it.

## The present
  At the moment my knowledge of actual software engineering is very slim. Yeah I've coded a few homework assignments that allowed me recursively find the greatest common factor of two digits but it wasn't really anything great in the grand scheme of things. I've also started getting into game software development a couple of years ago but I'm still at a very beginner level. To summarize it up, I'm still new to the world of software engineering.
  
  ## Fighting On
  The software engineer battle isn't fought solo. It requires the aid of many other friends to create something really great. Up until now I've really only coded and worked on projects completely solo. I never really asked for others opinions or had help in fields that weren't my forte. Working forward I hope to work with many people to develop the communication and team work skills to create something amazing. Coding is something you can get good at with practice but developing skills to become a great team member for any development team can only be achieved with real life experiences.

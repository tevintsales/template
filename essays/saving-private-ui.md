## Save my crappy HTML!
Backend work has been my focus for the majority of my school career. I've gotten proficient using HTML, Javascript, SQL, etc but I would always have to settle making small changes by using CSS. I've never thought of my work as ugly but there was definitely a lack of something there. If only there was some way to redesign my websites in an more simple and clean way.

## Semantic UI to the rescue
I'm not going to say that Semantic UI is the complete solution to fixing up UI but it is definitely a step in the right direction. Semantic UI will breathe some new life into the dull HTML/CSS strict website. Your UI can be cleaned up by simply adding class tags in simple English. If you want a button, give it a class of ui button. Simple as that. But to go even further if you want a big red button, you can easily change the class tag to be ui big red button. 

## It isn't all simple 
Learning a new framework is always a challenge. There are many times when I think that a certain framework or software is worthless when I can't figure out how to work with it. Semantic UI is similar in this regard. The user-friendly syntax of Semantic isn't always friendly. When I assign a specific class and get a different result it can be extremely frustrating. I can understand that Semantic UI is a powerful framework if used to its full potential but the learning curve is definitely something to think about.

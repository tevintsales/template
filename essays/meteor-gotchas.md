## Cooking with Meteor
My experience with the Meteor so far has been equvivalent to baking. You gather ingredients, make some dough, and then put it in the oven to bake. Baking takes a long time to finish and I've found that Meteor is the same way. The time it takes to create a project and run in Meteor ranges from 25 minutes to an hour. I don't have the greatest of computers but taking an hour to load seems like overkill to me. My solution to this ridiculous wait time? I simply enjoy life and wait it out. Sometimes I watch some TV shows, other times I play games or read books. Maybe down the line I might actually bake something. This isn't the most ideal solution, or rather it might not even be a solution at all but as long as the job gets done at the end of the day there really isn't any problem.

## The fight between Meteor and IntelliJ
  Having no other experience with application development environemnts other than Android studio I find Meteor to be pretty useful. That is after overlooking the fact that it takes an absurd amount of time to create and run projects. Having said that, once you get it up and running development goes fairly smoothly within IntelliJ. There is, however, an issue that I've kept running into while developing. That issue is the npm update in IntelliJ. After creating and running the project IntelliJ will prompt the user to update their npm dependenceies. Not knowing any better I would simply click away and have IntelliJ do its thing. This was a big mistake on my end as it caused the meteor project to become unusable and had me wipe my current progress and go through the whole process of creating and running an application all over again. The solution to this, don't update your npm dependencies through IntelliJ. Just don't.

  All of my life I've always enjoyed the thrill of playing video games. They can tell you heart warming stories or they can take you on adventures to various different universes. They allow you to step in the shoes of a princess saving warrior, an italian plumber, or a kid about to venture off into the world with amazing pets by your side. People all around the world enjoy video games and the market for them has never been greater. So, after a while of reading a lot of articles about game development and the itch to create my own video game growing stronger I decided to put my foot in the door and just create something.

## Be me, the level one character...
  Like my favorite Pokemon trainer Red, all I could say was '...'. I wanted to create the game of my dreams and have eveyone play it, but "Game Development The Game" isn't that simple. I thought I could get by as just a programmer but I was wrong. Game development isn't only about being a decent programmer. Games consist of artwork, music, storytelling, human-interface interactions, and so much more. I couldn't just put all of my skill points into coding. I had to branch out and learn more.

## Slowly leveling up
  Instead of just giving up I decided to take it slowly and start smaller. I followed many only tutorials to learn different game engines. I practiced making music using various programs. I tried my hand at doing 2D sprite artwork. 
  
>After a couple years of keeping at it I still haven't released an actual game and I'm fine with that.

I found that rushing won't allow me to make games that I'd have fun playing. If I wouldn't have fun playing it why bother creating it?
To those who want to get into game development my best advice is to take your time and make smaller scale games. From those small games learn, grow, and use the experiences from those to make an even better game next time.

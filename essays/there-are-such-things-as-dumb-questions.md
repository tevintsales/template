## Think before you ask!
There are many reasons why things don't always go the way they seem, this is especially the case for software engineering and programming. A lot of people are quick to post a "HELP ME!" to Stack Overflow or hardware issue sites like "Tom's Hardware" expecting someone to answer their question without putting any effort into it themselves. I've had several issues with my computer that I built a while back and I had tried to post my problem online hoping somebody could save me. If you ever put a vague "Help me my video card isn't working" summary for a post no one will ever save you, trust me. 

## Put in the effort to solve your problems first!
People will only help those who help themselves. This is true in almost any aspect of the world. If you don't take the time to even attempt to solve your problem then no one will want to use their time either. From my own experiences I've learned that if your problem isn't something extremely specific odds are that there are others that have had your problem as well. You can use those previous solutions on your problem and see the results. If you cannot figure it out after actually putting in effort then it's time to reach out.

# The dumb question.
People say that there is no such thing as a dumb question. That is false. A good example of a dumb question would be <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46084911/what-is-the-working-rule-of-this-program-explanation">this</a>. As you can see the person in question had put in no effort to actually even figure out what his problem is therefore he/she had received zero answers. 

# The Smart Way!
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45911954/scala-registry-design-pattern-or-similar">Asking the smart way!</a>
From this person's problem it is obvious to see that the person had tried to solve it themselves first. They have formatted the question in a way that gets straight to the point and asks for pointer references instead of the solution so that they can solve it themselves. Because of this, the person had four answers which point him in directions to go from there and even one high quality answer that eventually helps him solve the problem. 

# To summarize...
As you can see from these examples asking a smart question leads you to great answers. If you take the effort to actually formulate a good question people will help.

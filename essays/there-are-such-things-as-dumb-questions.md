## Think before you ask!
There are many reasons why things don't always go the way they seem, this is especially the case for software engineering and programming. A lot of people are quick to post a "HELP ME!" to Stack Overflow or hardware issue sites like "Tom's Hardware" expecting someone to answer their question without putting any effort into it themselves. I've had several issues with my computer that I built a while back and I had tried to post my problem online hoping somebody could save me. If you ever put a vague "Help me my video card isn't working" summary for a post no one will ever save you, trust me.

## Put in the effort to solve your problems first!
People will only help those who help themselves. This is true in almost any aspect of the world. If you don't take the time to even attempt to solve your problem then no one will want to use their time either. From my own experiences I've learned that if your problem isn't something extremely specific odds are that there are others that have had your problem as well.

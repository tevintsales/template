  About a year ago I took a class on website development which used languages that included HTML, CSS, and Javascript. However, since then, I took several other courses that required me to learn various different coding languages that weren't similar to Javascript at all
thus making me forget a lot of what I used in the past. When I was told that I'd have to do 106 exercises on the basics of Javascript I 
was actually glad because I'd be getting in practice. 

## ES 6??
  Before starting the exercises I could only recall functions that were often used in my website development class such as getElementById and the onClick event. If someone were to ask me to code a basic calculation function in Javascript I wasn't confident that I'd be able to do it. About 50 exercises in I was confident that I understood Javascript again. In terms of ES6, using let and const instead of var is something that I can get used to easily but ES6 for loops will take some time to remember it's actually there.
  
## Becoming a Software Athlete
  In my honest opinion, the athletic software engineering and overall structure of the class is one of the best education experiences 
I've had so far. Ignoring the fact that we are only two weeks into the semester, I believe that I can get a lot more out of this
structure rather than a normal one hour lecture course. Let's be real, an average student can only pay close attention to someone
lecturing for so long. WOD's are also new experience for me. Practice WODs are a great way to train my Javascript skills because they simulate the real deal that will come every Thursday. It helps that I've taken an algorithm course just a couple months ago so 
solving a problem in my head before coding actually helps tremendously so I don't get stressed out by them.
  
## My philosopy of training
  I've played soccer all of my life and I fully believe in the idea of "what you put in, is what you get out". In other words, the results
for anything will be determined by how much effort you put into it. Whether it be actual sports or software engineering, if one gets
efficient practice in something they will be able to handle many difficult situations that may come.

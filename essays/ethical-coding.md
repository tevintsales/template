## What is Ethics?
As children we grow up while being taught by our parents about what is bad or what is something that shouldn't be done. To reinforce the idea
we are often scolded or punished for undesired behavior and eventually come to understand that we shouldn't do something bad and only do
good things. The idea of doing good things due to an outside influence is the definition of ethics. An actual definition for the word ethics is as follows: "moral principles that govern a person's behavior or the conducting of an activity." I believe that this is
similar to my definition in a sense that the moral principles are the ideas being taught by parents. As a child it is your parents that enforce
their moral principles on you. While going to school, teachers as well as your peers further your ideals and create more depth to your
principles. To generalize this idea, the society one lives in really is what shapes the ethic standards to follow.

Bringing this idea to Software Engineering is nothing different. Your morals and ethics will still be a part of you and will continue to change
with the new environment that you'll face known as software engineering.  

## Riding to the future
A hot topic within the realm of software engineering ethics is the idea of Automatic Driving Cars or Self Driving Cars. As a software engineer that
designs the algorithms that deal with self-driving cars one must address significant ethical issues that come up. One of these issues is the situation
in which an unavoidable accident occurs. What would you program the car to do? Let's say that you had to create an algorithm to choose between swerving to avoid killing many pedestrians or sacrificing yourself(the driver) to save more lives. Your ethics may tell you to prioritize the number of lives, the notion of sacrificing one for the sake of many. But there are many "what if" scenarios that can be exploited. For example, what if there were children in the car? An algorithm could be responsible for ending a life that has so many years ahead of it. The general consensus and most ethical decision in society is notion of saving more lives is better than just one life. However the idea that the car would sacrifice the driver (the consumer) in a critical situation is something that just does not appeal to people. Yes they understand that self-driving cars and the like are cool and nice but they would never want to be in a situation where their lives aren't prioritized. Therefore no one would even want to buy the cars in the first place. An engineer has many solutions they could implement to finish this but there is no such thing as a correct solution. It is up to the designers ethical decisions to create what they feel would be the best. And that is a difficult task to do.

## My thoughts on the topic
I believe it would be the most ethical to choose the notion to sacrifice the driver in an unavoidable situation. I would choose this design and enforce the idea that the customer using the car is knowing of this fact. There are many times when the customers life could be threatened when they aren't driving. Public transportation is a good example of this as the customer asks to go from one place to another and they really have no control of the driving force that gets them there. They could be on a bus, plane, or train. It doesn't really matter in the end because the fact remains the same. They aren't the one in control and when an unavoidable situation happens anything can really happen.

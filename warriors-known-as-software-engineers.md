  Technology is alive. It is a forever growing beast that we need to be able to tame and use to our advantage. It is up to the Software Engineers to battle the beast and create user experiences for the common people. 

## Software in the world
  Whether you realize it or not, software is present in almost everything in the world. It could be a part of an actual computer or manufactured by the machinery that utilizes it.

## Slowly leveling up
  Instead of just giving up I decided to take it slowly and start smaller. I followed many only tutorials to learn different game engines. I practiced making music using various programs. I tried my hand at doing 2D sprite artwork. 
  
>After a couple years of keeping at it I still haven't released an actual game and I'm fine with that.

I found that rushing won't allow me to make games that I'd have fun playing. If I wouldn't have fun playing it why bother creating it?
To those who want to get into game development my best advice is to take your time and make smaller scale games. From those small games learn, grow, and use the experiences from those to make an even better game next time.
